# Artist Portfolio Website

This is a minimalistic portfolio site for an artist or painter. It allows you to:

- Display an image gallery
- Upload new images (after logging in)
- Write simple blog posts

The site is implemented in PHP so it can run on most web hosts without extra dependencies.

## Setup

1. Ensure PHP is installed on your server.
2. From this directory run:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Open <http://localhost:8000/index.php> in your browser.

Login with `artist` / `password` to post or upload images.
